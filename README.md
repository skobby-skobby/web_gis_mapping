A web map in GIS (Geographic Information Systems) is an interactive map that is accessible through a web browser. 
It allows users to view, explore, and analyze geographic data online without needing specialized GIS software installed on their local machines. 
Web maps typically combine various layers of spatial data such as satellite imagery, street maps, and thematic layers, 
and can include tools for zooming, panning, querying features, and sometimes editing or adding data.
